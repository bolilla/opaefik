House Atreides /əˈtreɪdiːz/ is a fictional noble family from the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. One of the Great Houses of the feudal interstellar empire known as the Padishah Empire (often referred to as the Imperium), its members play a role in every novel in the series. It is suggested within the series that the root of the Atreides line is the mythological Greek House of Atreus. In Homer's Iliad, the brothers Agamemnon and Menelaus are dubbed "the Atreides", meaning "the sons of Atreus".

House Atreides rules the water planet of Caladan, employing noble spirit, just ways, and virtue in its endeavors. Also proficient in war, the family has even developed an Atreides battle language. In the 1984 film version, this language is presented as a system of hand signals; the novels also include a spoken language. The colors of House Atreides are green and black, and their symbol is a red hawk.
